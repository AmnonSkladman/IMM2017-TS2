# CANKinectPhysics

# Make sure to include the following libraries:
# ---------------------------------------------
# import org.openkinect.processing.*;
# import blobDetection.*; // blobs
# import toxi.geom.*; // toxiclibs shapes and vectors
# import toxi.processing.*; // toxiclibs display
# import shiffman.box2d.*; // shiffman's jbox2d helper library
# import org.jbox2d.collision.shapes.*; // jbox2d
# import org.jbox2d.dynamics.joints.*;
# import org.jbox2d.common.*; // jbox2d
# import org.jbox2d.dynamics.*; // jbox2d
# ----------------------------------------------
# The code has many comments throughout, so feel free to copy the cody and change things as you desire.
# For some reason, though, there seems to be a framerate issue with Box2D and Kinect in Processing that we haven't been able to figure out. Feel free to debug it!
